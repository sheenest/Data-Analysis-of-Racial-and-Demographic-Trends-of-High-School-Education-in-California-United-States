# J124-Final-Project

<h1>Project Description</h1>
In this project, I will be looking into racial and demographic equality in the education system in the State of Caifornia in the United States. I would be looking specifically into yearly Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rates(ACGR) from the graduation years of 2016-2017 to 2021-2022. 
The data is from the California Department of Education and can be found here: [https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/filesacgr.asp](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/filesacgr.asp). 

In this project, I will investigating the how the Graduation and Dropout rates of High School (Grade 9-12) vary across different races (African Americam, White, Hispanic, etc) , as well as the Demographic Background ( Socioeconomically Disadvantaged, Migrant, Foster, etc). Through doing so, I aim to look for signs for racial and demographic inequality and how they may differ across different counties and school districts.

<h2>Interviewees</h2>
At the end of the project, I hope to interview the following people whom I would believe would find this project useful in allocating resources and implementing policies to help support social subggroups that may be racially or financially disadvangted in their high school education.
