# J124-Final-Project: Data Analysis of Racial and Demographic Trends of High School Education in California, United States.

<h1>Project Description</h1>
In this project, I will be looking into Racial and Demographic equality in the education system in the State of Caifornia in the United States. In doing so, I would be looking specifically into yearly Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rates(ACGR) of High Schools (Grade 9-12) of the Academic Years 2016-2017 to 2021-2022. Through this data, the Yearly Graduation and Dropout Rates across race and demographic of schools across all School Districts and Counties in California are retrieved and compared for analysis.

The data is from the California Department of Education and can be found here: [https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/filesacgr.asp](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/filesacgr.asp). 

In this project, I will be looking into the Graduation and Dropout rates of all vary across different races (African Americam, White, Hispanic, etc) , as well as the Demographic Background ( Socioeconomically Disadvantaged, Migrant, Foster, etc). Through doing so, I aim to look for signs for racial and demographic inequality and how they may differ across different counties and school districts.

<h2>Interviewees</h2>
At the end of the project, I hope to interview the following people whom I would believe would find this project useful in allocating resources and implementing policies to help support social subggroups that may be racially or financially disadvangted in their high school education.
