# J124-Final-Project: Data Analysis of Racial and Demographic Trends of High School Education in California, United States.

<h1>Project Description</h1>
In this project, I will be looking into Trends of Graduation and Dropout Rates across Race and Demography in the education system in Caifornia, United States. In doing so, I would be looking specifically into yearly Adjusted Cohort Graduation Rates(ACGR) of High Schools (Grade 9-12) of the Academic Years 2016-2017 to 2021-2022. Through this data, the Yearly Graduation and Dropout Rates across race and demography of schools across all School Districts and Counties in California are retrieved and compared for analysis.

The data is from the California Department of Education and can be found here: [https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/filesacgr.asp](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/ad/filesacgr.asp). 

<h2>Analysis Questions</h2>
1.  What are the Top 5 Counties that had the highest Dropout Rates in 2022?
2.  For the Top 5 Countries with the highest Dropout rates in 2022, how did the dropout rates vary from 2017 to 2022? Which countries had a significant increase in Dropout Rates after 2019?
3.  For the Top 5 Countries with the highest Dropout rates in 2022, how did the Dropout Rates vary across Race from 2017 to 2022?
4.  For the Top 5 Countries with the highest Dropout rates in 2022, how did the Dropout Rates vary across Demographic Background from 2017 to 2022?
5.  For the Top 5 Countries with the highest Dropout rates in 2022, which County had the highest Proportion of Senior Year Students who are still enrolled and which County had the lowest graduation rate?


<h2>Interviewees</h2>
At the end of the project, I hope to interview the following people whom I would believe would find this project useful in allocating resources and implementing policies to help support social subggroups that may be racially or financially disadvangted in their high school education.
